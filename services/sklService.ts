/**
 * Simulates applying AI-driven tuning suggestions to a binary .skl file.
 * In a real desktop application, this function would contain complex logic
 * to parse the proprietary .skl format, locate the correct fuel/ignition tables,
 * and modify the cell values according to the AI's suggestions.
 * 
 * For this simulation, it simply reads the original file and returns a new Blob
 * containing the same data, demonstrating the file I/O workflow.
 * 
 * @param baseMapFile The original .skl file provided by the user.
 * @param suggestions The AI-generated tuning suggestions.
 * @returns A Promise that resolves to a Blob representing the "modified" .skl file.
